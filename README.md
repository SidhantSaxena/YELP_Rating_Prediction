# Yelp_Review_Rating_Prediction

## About
This study evaluates Sentence-BERT embeddings for rating prediction, highlighting their strength in capturing semantic meaning regardless of sentence structure. Ensemble models offered limited gains due to weak base learners and overlapping mid-range classes. Performance may improve by reducing label granularity to three classes: negative (1), neutral (3), and positive (5).
